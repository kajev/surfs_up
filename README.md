# surfs_up
Exploring weather data in VS code and jupyter notebook

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to comopare the values of the temperatures in the months of june and december to see if a surf and ice cream shop is a viable business. These are usually the hottest and coldest months of the year and are half a year apart so it serves as a good reference point.
## Results
-The average temperature only dorps around 3 points from june to december
-The minimum tmeperature drops 8 degrees
-While the maximum only drops 2 degrees from june
## Summary
As the temperature seems to be high throughout the year, this implies there will be atleast some sort of demand for ice cream even in the winter. So the shop will have business as Oahu's average temperature stays high during winter months. Also, this means people will be wanting to rent surf boards as the temperature is still relatively high on most days. The minimum being 56 degrees farenheit isn't even too cold to go surfing in. Further analysis could be done if we had data on the water and waves that come in to determine ideal months or even weeks to promote surfing to get more revenue..
